# Quality Settings
Adds graphics options to the game, since Liam hasn't implemented them yet.

## Setup
To setup, first place the mod binary into your mods folder, and then run the game. If the mod is installed correctly, you should see an initialization message in the console. After first time setup, you will be able to find the config file in `[Your Game Directory]/UserData/QualitySettings.cfg`.

## Settings
`DisableGrass`: Disables rendering of all grass objects. Improves performance.
